# Kubernetes Management Dashboard

A custom Graphical User Interface (GUI) layer that directly interfaces with the Kubernetes API. More specifically, the GUI will be used to:

*Create unique namespaces for organizational categories where required on the different clusters for example based on teams such as development, production and testing. This will allow clients to logically separate concerns while ensuring Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) of services.

*Deploy and manage containerised applications (deployment, scalability and cluster data replication). This will help clients to easily manage their applications using an intuitive interface with no need to master and interface with the command line interface of a UNIX-based system.

*Manage external access to cluster services with possible load balancing definitions such as ingress and DNS. Services defined in the cluster require external access and this is challenging especially in bare metal environments. A combination of DNS, ingress and popular load balancing solutions will be further explored and findings used to inform the approach.
